## Profile

Engineering leader with a unique blend of hands-on software expertise (Golang preferred), architectural skills, people development, and strategic product thinking. I build high-performing engineering organizations, create clarity and direction, and deliver impactful products across diverse domains: e-commerce, HR-tech, prop-tech, finance, and the built environment.

My leadership philosophy is simple: serve the needs of people and the business, build trust, and create an environment where developers thrive and technology meaningfully advances company goals. I move comfortably between coding, coaching, DevOps/infrastructure, architecture, and strategic leadership.
