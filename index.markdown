## Profile

Engineering leader with a unique blend of hands-on software expertise (Golang preferred), architectural skills, people development, and strategic product thinking. I build high-performing engineering organizations, create clarity and direction, and deliver impactful products across diverse domains: e-commerce, HR-tech, prop-tech, finance, and the built environment.

My leadership philosophy is simple: serve the needs of people and the business, build trust, and create an environment where developers thrive and technology meaningfully advances company goals. I move comfortably between coding, coaching, DevOps/infrastructure, architecture, and strategic leadership.

## Professional Experience

### (Engineering) Director, Digital Lab
**Royal HaskoningDHV** · 2017–Present

Founder and leader of the Digital Lab, a software innovation group within a purpose-driven engineering consultancy.

**Highlights & Impact**

- Royal HaskoningDHV needed software capabilities to complement its engineering consultancy. I founded the Digital Lab from scratch, recruiting and coaching 20+ developers, UX designers, and engineers into a high-performing team that now delivers critical digital products across the organization.

- Consultants were spending excessive time on repetitive document generation. I led the development of **Kes** (Knowledge Expert System), a hybrid LLM + knowledge-model platform that outperformed both pure LLM baselines and expert consultants in independent tests, delivering massive productivity gains company-wide.

- The Dutch Water Boards lacked a unified real-time view of national water infrastructure. I built a national-scale water management system with a geospatial data API that now powers government decision-making across all Dutch Water Boards.

- Infrastructure projects struggled to leverage digital twin technology effectively. I delivered 15+ digital twin integrations for major projects, work that was shortlisted for a **Bentley Digital Engineering Award**.

- The company had fragmented data across silos with no unified strategy. As Product Owner for the company-wide data platform (2024), I defined a vision using Domain-Driven Design and data mesh principles, then moved it from concept to production with operational data products now serving multiple business units.

### Senior Software Developer & Agile Coach
**Coolblue** · 2013–2017

Served as a nomadic integrator across multiple teams, improving engineering practices, data capabilities, and team cohesion.

**Key Contributions**

- Coolblue's rapid growth exposed limitations in its Business Intelligence infrastructure. I introduced Domain-Driven Design and transformed the BI environment into an analytics-ready data lake, improving data-driven decision-making by 40% and reducing processing times by 50%.

- Teams operated in silos with inconsistent practices. Working as an agile coach across multiple teams, I strengthened developer culture around ownership and craftsmanship, improving delivery flow and cross-team collaboration.
